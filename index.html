    <h2>Web Dev Concepts</h2>
    <!--Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers-->
    <p>
        The index is called the designated homepage on most web servers, and the index.html file
        in the root directory is called the homepage of the web application. Most web applications
        are configured to return the index file whenever a GET request is received with only a "/". 
    </p> 
    <!--Explain what you see in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector tools. What is different about the file's details on the web server
    vs the local computer?-->
    <p>
        The first difference I noticed between the web server and local computer was that in the web server's network tab, the file is referred to as
        a1-rectors/, vs on the local computer it is referred to as index.html. The next difference noticed was the web server's request URL's protocol 
        is HTTPS, vs the local computer protocol being file. The web server tab also has a lot more Response Headers (including Connection, Content Encoding, etc.)
        and Request Headers (including Accept-Encoding, Cookie, etc.) than the local computer tab.
    </p>
    <!--Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200 but the main.css and main.js files do not-->
    <p>
        The favicon.ico file returns a 200 status because the resource was successfully found and retrieved in the web.engr.oregonstate.edu server.
        The main.css and main.js files instead return a 404 Not Found status, because those resources were not found in the aforementioned
        server.
    </p>
    <!--Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What are the scheme, subdomain, host domain, and resources?-->
    <p>
        The scheme (protocol) of my web file is HTTPS, signifying the data transferred is encrypted. The subdomains of my web file are web and engr
        (web.engr.) and the host domain is oregonstate.edu. The resource specified for my web file is a1-rectors/, which as expected defaults to
        retrieve the index.html file from the a1-rectors location in the web server.
    </p>
