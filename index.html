            <h2>Web Dev Concepts</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <!--Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers-->
                <p>
                    The <strong>index</strong> is called the designated homepage on Apache web servers, and the index.html file
                    in the root directory is called the homepage of the web application. Most web applications
                    are configured to return the index file whenever a GET request is received with only a "/". 
                </p> 
                <!--Explain what you see in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector tools. What is different about the file's details on the web server
                vs the local computer?-->
                <p>
                    I navigated to the <strong>Network tab</strong> to view this information by opening each version (web and local) in Google Chrome, pressing CTRL + SHIFT + I (the shortcut
                    for Windows to open the  web console), and then pressing CTRL + R to refresh the data in the Network tab. At that point, I was able to click into the
                    loaded files and see the related information (Status code, Request Method, Response-Headers, Request-Headers, etc.).
                    The first difference I noticed between the web server and local computer was that in the web server's network tab, the file is referred to as
                    a1-rectors/, vs on the local computer it is referred to as index.html. The next difference noticed was the web server's request URL's <strong>protocol</strong>
                    is HTTPS, vs the local computer protocol being file. The web server tab also has a lot more <strong>Response Headers</strong> (including Connection, Content Encoding, etc.)
                    and <strong>Request Headers</strong> (including Accept-Encoding, Cookie, etc.) than the local computer tab. As a last note, both the server and computer had 200 
                    <strong>status codes</strong>.
                </p>
                <!--Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200 but the main.css and main.js files do not-->
                <p>
                    The favicon.ico file returns a 200 status because the resource was successfully found and retrieved in the web.engr.oregonstate.edu server.
                    The main.css and main.js files instead return a 404 Not Found status, because those resources were not found in the aforementioned
                    server.
                </p>
                <!--Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What are the scheme, subdomain, host domain, and resources?-->
                <p>
                    The <strong>scheme (protocol)</strong> of my web file is <strong>HTTPS</strong>, signifying the data transferred is encrypted. The <strong>subdomains</strong>
                    of my web file are web and engr (web.engr.) and the <strong>host domain</strong> is oregonstate.edu. The <strong>resource</strong> specified for my web file 
                    is a1-rectors/, which as expected  defaults to retrieve the index.html file from the a1-rectors location in the web server.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        <!--Explain the concept of frontend design-->
                        The core concept of <strong>frontend design</strong> is about creating the optimal experience for users. This concept includes components such as the visual
                        design of the page, the <strong>GUI (graphical user-interface)</strong> and the overall interactive experience that the user has. With regard to the specifics 
                        pertaining to visual design, it requires things like a consistent color scheme, font, illustration scheme, etc., as well as navigation 
                        systems that make logical sense for the user. Frontend design trends tend to change frequently, so it is important for frontend developers
                        to stay on top of the newest trends as they surface.
                    </p>

                        <dd>Helps users meet their goals with accurate results.</dd>

                        <dd>Users immediately know how to locate their goal by clicking/searching, and remember how to do it again the next time
                            they visit the page. This is especially important for users that have never used the page before.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><strong>Error-free</strong></dt>
                        <dd>Users do not run into roadblocks for their specific needs. This avoids accessibility and availability issues.</dd>
                        <dt><strong>Enjoyble to use(engaging)</strong></dt>
                        <dd>The needs of the intended audience are met in content and design, and they are planning to come back to the page thanks
                            to the overall positive experience.

                    <!--Explain the purpose of page layout tags-->
                    <p>
                        The main purpose of <strong>page layout tags</strong> (such as header, nav, main, etc.) is to section off and structure the flow of content on a web 
                        page. Page layout tags are very focused on organization rather than styling. For example, most page layout tags are displayed 
                        by browsers with a newline before and after the element, but beyond that it is up to the developer to use CSS to further style them.
                        Page layout blocks also help machines (including search engine robots, screen readers, etc.) to accurately understand which area of 
                        a web page contains which components.
                    </p>
                    <!--Explain how anchors link content from page to page, and differentiate between text anchors and navigation-->
                    <p>
                        <strong>Anchors</strong> link content by describing the content between the opening and closing anchor tags (the description itself is the link), and 
                        specifying the URL that the link will take the user to in a <strong>href</strong> attribute within the opening anchor tag. Anchors can be used to
                        link from one page to another, and they can also be used to link to a specific location within the document it is a part of. This is
                        done by adding an <strong>id</strong> attribute to the element the developer wants to link to, and then adding the value of the id attribute at the end 
                        of the URL specified in the anchor's href (example.html#examplelocation). The conceptual difference between <strong>text anchors</strong> and 
                        <strong>navigational anchors</strong> is that anchor tags typically link to sections within the same file, while navigational anchors specifically link 
                        externally to other files. Navigational anchors are also children of the <strong>nav</strong> tag and are typically displayed as buttons, whereas 
                        non-navigational anchors are typically displayed as text links.
