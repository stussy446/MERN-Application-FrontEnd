            <h2>Web Dev Concepts</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <!--Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers-->
                <p>
                    The index is called the designated homepage on Apache web servers, and the index.html file
                    in the root directory is called the homepage of the web application. Most web applications
                    are configured to return the index file whenever a GET request is received with only a "/". 
                </p> 
                <!--Explain what you see in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector tools. What is different about the file's details on the web server
                vs the local computer?-->
                <p>
                    I navigated to the Network tab to view this information by opening each version (web and local) in Google Chrome, pressing CTRL + SHIFT + I (the shortcut
                    for Windows to open the  web console), and then pressing CTRL + R to refresh the data in the Network tab. At that point, I was able to click into the
                    loaded files and see the related information (Status code, Request Method, Response-Headers, Request-Headers, etc.).
                    The first difference I noticed between the web server and local computer was that in the web server's network tab, the file is referred to as
                    a1-rectors/, vs on the local computer it is referred to as index.html. The next difference noticed was the web server's request URL's protocol 
                    is HTTPS, vs the local computer protocol being file. The web server tab also has a lot more Response Headers (including Connection, Content Encoding, etc.)
                    and Request Headers (including Accept-Encoding, Cookie, etc.) than the local computer tab. As a last note, both the server and computer had 200 
                    status codes.
                </p>
                <!--Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200 but the main.css and main.js files do not-->
                <p>
                    The favicon.ico file returns a 200 status because the resource was successfully found and retrieved in the web.engr.oregonstate.edu server.
                    The main.css and main.js files instead return a 404 Not Found status, because those resources were not found in the aforementioned
                    server.
                </p>
                <!--Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What are the scheme, subdomain, host domain, and resources?-->
                <p>
                    The scheme (protocol) of my web file is HTTPS, signifying the data transferred is encrypted. The subdomains of my web file are web and engr
                    (web.engr.) and the host domain is oregonstate.edu. The resource specified for my web file is a1-rectors/, which as expected defaults to
                    retrieve the index.html file from the a1-rectors location in the web server.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                    <p>
                    <!--Explain the concept of frontend design-->
                    The core concept of frontend design is about creating the optimal experience for users. This concept includes components such as the visual
                    design of the page, the GUI (graphical user-interface) and the overall interactive experience that the user has. With regard to the specifics 
                    pertaining to visual design, it requires things like a consistent color scheme, font, illustration scheme, etc., as well as navigation 
                    systems that make logical sense for the user. Frontend design trends tend to change frequently, so it is important for frontend developers
                    to stay on top of the newest trends as they surface.
